Lets build a system of 7 agents on Claude Sonnet 4.6 that analyzes Google Maps in small towns, finds small businesses without websites there, and over 1 weekend 
takes each one to a finished mockup with video and cold message.

Traditional web design agencies keep teams of 8 people on salary for the same order flow, while his expenses are only tokens and subscriptions to Lovable, Higgsfield, 
and Calendly.

7 agents work through 1 orchestrator on Claude Code Router. Usage is about 3 million tokens a day, the average API bill is about $480 a month.

All 7 go through MCP servers and write shared state to the file system, without shared state in memory and without race conditions, and 1 of them lives right in 
the iPhone and picks up positive replies from the subway, a taxi, or on walks.

And here is the system prompt he put into the orchestrator before launch:

```
"You are the orchestrator of a solo agency that sells ready-made websites to local businesses. You delegate read-only tasks to 6 sub-agents and own all writes.
```

# Sub-agents

- **Scout** (walks through Google Maps in selected cities, looks for narrow niches: 5+ years on the map, fewer than 50 reviews, no website or a website from 2014, 
but high ratings)
- **Diagnoser** (for each lead writes a 50-word diagnosis, hero angle, tone matched to the industry, and a cold message under 70 words)
- **Builder** (generates a landing page mockup in Lovable through MCP only for the top 5 leads per day, with the sharpest diagnoses and the biggest gap)
- **Filmer** (pulls 5 screenshots of the mockup and through Higgsfield renders a 10-second vertical video 1080x1920 with a soft zoom)
- **Pitcher** (sends a personalized cold message through the right channel for the niche: email to roofers, SMS to tradesmen, IG DM to salons, LinkedIn to realtors)
- **Checker** (runs every message through evals for personalization, absence of AI markers and buzzwords before sending)
- **Mobile** (lives in the iPhone, handles positive replies in real time, books Zoom calls in Calendly through MCP while the owner is on the go).

You never let 2 sub-agents touch 1 lead. You stop and request approval from the human only when a deal exceeds $3,000 or the reply rate in a niche for the day 
drops below 12%."

Meaning the system knows what it is and within what boundaries it is allowed to act.

It knows it is supposed to find leads on its own.

It knows it is supposed to take each one to a mockup, video, and cold message without intervention.

It knows the human only steps in when a deal goes above $3,000 or the reply rate stops converging.

→ The system runs 24 hours a day
→ Scout goes through about 220 local businesses on Google Maps per day and leaves 30 new leads in the queue
→ Diagnoser outputs 30 structured diagnoses + briefs + cold messages per day
→ Builder assembles 3 to 5 finished landing pages in Lovable for the sharpest leads
→ Filmer renders a 10-second vertical video in Higgsfield for each one
→ Pitcher sends 30 personalized messages per day across 4 channels with a reply rate of about 14%
→ Checker runs every message through evals before sending

And only when a deal breaks $3,000 or the reply rate for the day drops below 12% does the orchestrator wake the owner.

And when the owner at that moment is sitting in the subway or a taxi, the Mobile agent in his iPhone picks up 1 move on its own: replies to a fresh positive reply 
from a dentist, books a Zoom through Calendly synced to the local time of the client, and puts the lead back in the queue. The owner only has to tap "approve" and in 
just 10 minutes join the call.

Here is what the system writes in his log during 1 of the Saturdays:

"scout report: 218 businesses checked in Austin, Denver, and Miami, 34 without a website, 19 with a website from 2014, 6 with an active redesign request in reviews. 
passing top 30 to diagnoser."

"pitcher: 30 cold messages sent across 4 channels, 14 replies, 5 positive, 3 Zoom calls booked for Sunday. passing to closer."

"builder: landing page for Westside Cosmetic Dentistry built in Lovable, 5 sections, mobile, soft beige. URL placed at /Users/dev/maps-agency/clients/westside/v1. filmer launching Higgsfield."

"eval flag: deal with The Lotus Salon at $3,400 exceeds the approved limit of $3,000. sending for manual review."

He has no server of his own and no separate backend.

Just a local file sandbox at /Users/dev/maps-agency, an MCP router, 1 API key to Claude, and the same key forwarded to Claude Code on his iPhone.

Out of everything I have seen this year, this is the cleanest one-person agency for selling websites to small businesses: $480 a month on the API, about $18,800 into the account, and between them 7 prompts, 1 file system, and 1 phone in the pocket.

# The stack that you need to print:
> Google Maps finds local businesses with bad or missing websites.
> Claude writes personalized outreach and site briefs in one prompt batch. 
> Lovable builds a working hosted landing page mockup in 5 minutes.
> Higgsfield generates a 10-second cinematic walkthrough video of the mockup.

The prospect opens your message and sees a finished version of what they would buy. 

They are not deciding whether to start a project, they are deciding whether to buy this specific one, that changes the whole conversation.

# Step 1: Find the Right Leads
Pick a niche where the owner is not technical and the website is critical to revenue. Best ones: roofers, landscapers, plumbers, fence installers, chimney repair, 
HVAC, dental practices, salons, law firms, real estate agents, photographers, event venues.

Avoid: e-commerce, franchises, anything national, anything where the owner is not the decision maker.

Open Google Maps and hunt.

Type a narrow query, not "dentists in Austin," but "cosmetic dentists in West Austin." The narrower the search, the better the leads.

Skip the top three or four results. Those are the businesses crushing it already, hundreds of reviews, modern site, no urgency to change anything. The leads you want 
sit just below them.

Look for the sweet spot pattern:
- Established business, 5+ years on the map
- Low review count, under 50
- Either no website link in their profile, or a "Website" button that opens something built in 2014
- Solid reviews despite the bad online presence

These are the gold mines. Owners who have been crushing it offline for years and never got around to fixing the online side. The gap between what they have and what 
you can show them is dramatic, which is exactly why the pitch lands.

Click into each one, copy the basics into a doc: business name, current website (or "none"), phone number, location, and one specific detail you noticed (a standout 
review, a unique service, something on their profile that makes them them).

Aim for 25-30 leads from a single niche in one city. Once you have the list, hand it to Claude to enrich and structure:

```
Here is my raw list of [niche] in [city] from Google Maps. 

For each business, add:
- A one-line read on what is wrong with their current online presence
- A unique angle I could use in outreach based on what I noted
- The specific gap a new website would close

Format as a clean markdown table with the original columns plus 
your additions. Keep it sharp, no buzzwords, no fluff.

Here is the list:
[paste your list]
```

You now have a structured prospect list with personalized hooks for every single business, ready to feed into Step 2.

# Step 2: Run the List Through Claude
One prompt, three deliverables per business:

```
You are a senior local marketing strategist. For each business in 
the list below, generate three deliverables:

1. Diagnosis (50 words): what is wrong with their current online 
presence and what revenue is leaking because of it. Be concrete, 
no buzzwords.

2. Site brief (100 words): hero angle, key services to highlight, 
tone that fits the industry, the call to action that will convert, 
one design choice that sets them apart from local competitors.

3. Cold message (under 70 words): opens with one specific observation 
about THIS business, references their actual service or location, 
ends with a soft ask to see a mockup. Sound like a real person who 
looked them up. No corporate language. No mention of AI tools.

Format as a clean table I can paste into a CRM.

Here is the list:
[paste CSV]
```

Tell Claude what to avoid (buzzwords, corporate language, AI mentions) explicitly. The output should sound like a different person wrote each row.

# Step 3: Build Mockups in Lovable (Only for Top Leads)
Do not build for all 30 leads, build for your top 5-8.
Pick the leads with the most specific diagnoses, the highest-rated businesses, or the dramatic before/after potential. These are the ones who will reply.

Lovable prompt template:
```
Build a landing page for [business name], a [specific business type] 
in [city].

Audience: [describe specifically].
Brand feel: [3 specific adjectives].
Hero focus: [angle from Claude's brief].

Sections in order:
1. Hero with primary CTA
2. Three core services
3. About with credibility positioning
4. Social proof / testimonials placeholder
5. Final CTA section

Design: [specific color palette, not "modern"], generous whitespace, 
mobile-first, subtle scroll animations, no flashy effects.

Tone: [specific to industry].

Avoid: AI-looking gradients, generic stock photos, "Welcome to" 
headlines, "Your trusted partner" copy.
```

Hit publish. You now have a live URL. Save it.

For everyone else on your list, the message and mockup-on-request offer is enough. Build only for the prospects most likely to convert.

# Step 4: Generate Demo Videos in Higgsfield
Static screenshots get ignored. A 10-second video of their site in motion gets replied to.

Upload 3-5 screenshots from your Lovable mockup. Hero, services, about, social proof, CTA.

Higgsfield prompt:
```
Create a 10-second cinematic walkthrough using these landing page 
mockup images.

Camera: slow zoom on hero (2 seconds), smooth pan to services, 
gentle ease into about, end on final CTA with soft fade.

Style: premium, cinematic, professional. Subtle motion on text. 
Soft depth of field. Modern editorial feel.

Format: 9:16 vertical, 1080x1920.

Avoid: dramatic zooms, fast cuts, aggressive color grading.
```

Vertical format matters because most prospects open emails on their phones. Vertical plays inline like content, horizontal feels like an attachment.

# Step 5: Send the Outreach
The rule that breaks 90% of outreach: do not mention AI, Claude, Lovable, or any tool you used. The prospect cares about results, not your stack. The moment 
you say "I built this with AI," you sound like every other AI cosplayer in their inbox.

The cold message format:

```
Hey [first name], built you a quick site mockup based on what 
I saw on your Google profile.

[One specific observation that proves you actually looked.]

10-second walkthrough: [Higgsfield video link]
Full preview: [Lovable URL]

If it looks close to what you would want, happy to chat. 
If not, no worries.

[Your name]
```

Under 70 words. The video sells. The preview link proves you did the work. The soft close removes pressure.
Subject lines that work: "Built something for [business name]," "Quick mockup for [business name]," "Saw your reviews, made you something."
Subject lines that get deleted: "Quick question," "Improving your website," "Free consultation."

# Channel by niche:
Email: most niches default
SMS: contractors, trades, plumbers
Instagram DM: salons, restaurants, visual businesses
LinkedIn: law firms, financial services, B2B
Phone calls: contractors, cleaners, anyone older demographic
Follow-ups: if no reply after 4 days, send one. If no reply after another 7 days, send a second from a different angle. Then archive.

For follow-ups, ask Claude:

```
Write two follow-ups for this prospect, both under 50 words. 
Message 1: reference a specific gap in their current site. 
Message 2: reference what a competitor is doing better. 
Same tone as the original. No AI mentions.
```

# What Actually Closes the Deal? 💸
The mockup is the icebreaker. The Zoom call is what closes.
When a prospect replies positive, get them on a 10-15 minute Zoom. Walk through the mockup with them on screen. Ask what they would change. Take notes. 
Quote them on the spot.

By the time they are on the call, they have already imagined themselves with the new site. They are not deciding whether to buy a website, they are deciding 
whether to buy this specific website. Close rate from positive reply runs 30-50%.

# The math, why it works?
Send 30 personalized sequences this weekend. 10-15% reply rate. 3-4 positive replies. 30-50% close rate.
That is 1-2 deals per weekend.

Monthly model: $500-1,000 in new MRR every weekend. Two weekends a month = $2,000-4,000 new MRR. 

Six months = $12,000-24,000 monthly recurring.
One-time model: $2,500-10,000 cash per weekend.
